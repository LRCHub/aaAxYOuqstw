I think it's time we slow it down
I think it's time we slow it down

I think it's time we slow it down
Country roads are calling
Heading for that hallowed ground
Gonna do some roamin' around

Take a ride in the ole blue moon
Hear that diesel hummin'
Singing songs by the crackling fire
Get your guitar strummin' along

Few miles down the ole dirt road
Where nobody knows my name
Take my time and ease my mind
Singing songs from yesterday

Yeah, I think it's time we slow it down
Where them bass are biting
Catching crawfish in the ditch
In their holes they're hiding out

Quiet nights beneath the sky
Hear them bullfrogs croaking
I don't need no reason why
I can do some toking alone

Honey holes and fishing poles
Feel that mud between my feet
Slip and slide and country fried
Running from that summer heat

Yeah, I think it's time we slow it down
And we just might see it
Mother Nature's picture show
Take a seat and breathe it in
